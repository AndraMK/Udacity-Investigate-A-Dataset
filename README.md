Investigate a dataset, Data Wrangling, and Exploratory Data Analysis

This project analyzed trend data from the US Census and FBI's NICS gun background check database. The emphasis of this project was to gain experience in Data Wrangling and Exploratory Data Analysis. 

Both datasets were uploaded, cleaned, and merged to create a single datafile to perform Exploratory Data Analysis. Simple analyses and plots were utilized to convey insights.
